**Agenda**   

The session is open ended with an emphasis on collaborative discussion and loosely organized into the following three parts –  

* A general introduction to Blockchain and blockchain related technologies – this would depend on the composition of the group. If most of the people who turn up have a grasp of blockchain basics this is usually skipped.

* Proposed talks on specific topics related to blockchain and blockchain related stuff. Everyone is welcome to propose and do talks if they are interested.In fact we would love it if you would comment and let us know if you are planning to do something a few days before the event so we can update the theme.

* Q&A and discussion on anything from the earlier section that anyone wants clarification and elaboration on.
